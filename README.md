Collaborative Global-Local Networks for Memory-Efﬁcient Segmentation of Ultra-High Resolution Images

Wuyang Chen*, Ziyu Jiang*, Zhangyang Wang, Kexin Cui, and Xiaoning Qian

In CVPR 2019 (Oral).

## Overview

Segmentation of ultra-high resolution images is increasingly demanded in a wide range of applications (e.g. urban planning), yet poses signiﬁcant challenges for algorithm efficiency, in particular considering the (GPU) memory limits.

We propose collaborative **Global-Local Networks (GLNet)** to effectively preserve both global and local information in a highly memory-efficient manner.

* **Memory-efficient**: training w. only one 1080Ti and inference w. less than 2GB GPU memory, for ultra-high resolution images of up to 30M pixels.

* **High-quality**: GLNet outperforms existing segmentation models on ultra-high resolution images.

GLNet: the global and local branch takes downsampled and cropped images, respectively. Deep feature map sharing and feature map regularization enforce our global-local collaboration. The final segmentation is generated by aggregating high-level feature maps from two branches.

Deep feature map sharing between the global and local branch: at each layer, feature maps with global context and ones with local fine structures are bidirectionally brought together, contributing to a complete patch-based deep global-local collaboration.
