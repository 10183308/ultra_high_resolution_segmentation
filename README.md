## Overview
![Acc_vs_Mem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenwydj/ultra_high_resolution_segmentation/master/docs/images/deep_globe_acc_mem_ext.jpg)
*Inference memory v.s. mIoU on the [DeepGlobe dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06561). Downsampling rates or normalized patch sizes are shown in scale annotations.*

*Inference memory v.s. mIoU on the [DeepGlobe dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06561). Downsampling rates or normalized patch sizes are shown in scale annotations.*

GLNet (red dots) integrates both global and local information in a compact way, contributing to a well-balanced trade-off between accuracy and memory usage.*
